# üî® Building Standalone Executable

This guide shows how to create a standalone .exe file that can run on any Windows PC without Python or any other software installed (except a web browser).

## üìã Prerequisites (Only for Building)

The target PC needs **nothing**, but to BUILD the exe, you need:

- Python 3.8 or later
- All project dependencies installed
- PyInstaller

## üöÄ Quick Build (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install PyInstaller
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Step 2: Run Build Script
```bash
python build_exe.py
```

### Step 3: Get the Executable
The exe will be created at:
```
dist/TradeProcessingPipeline.exe
```

That's it! The exe is ready to distribute.

## üì¶ What Gets Built

**Single File**: `TradeProcessingPipeline.exe` (~500-800 MB)

**Includes**:
- Python 3.x interpreter
- Streamlit framework
- All dependencies (pandas, openpyxl, sendgrid, etc.)
- All project modules
- Configuration files

## üñ•Ô∏è Running on Target PC

### Requirements (on target PC)
- ‚úÖ Windows 7 or later
- ‚úÖ Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- ‚úÖ Internet connection (for Yahoo Finance)
- ‚ùå **NO Python required**
- ‚ùå **NO installations required**

### How to Use
1. Copy `TradeProcessingPipeline.exe` to any folder
2. Double-click to run
3. Application opens in web browser automatically
4. First launch may take 10-20 seconds (unpacking)

### How to Stop
- Close the console window that appears, OR
- Press Ctrl+C in the console window

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced: Custom Build Options

### Build with Console Window (for debugging)
Edit `build_exe.py` and change:
```python
'--windowed',  # Change to:
'--console',   # Shows console for debugging
```

### Add Custom Icon
1. Get a `.ico` file (256x256 recommended)
2. Edit `build_exe.py`:
```python
'--icon=NONE',  # Change to:
'--icon=myicon.ico',
```

### Reduce File Size
The exe is large because it includes everything. To reduce size:

1. **Use --onedir instead of --onefile** (creates folder with multiple files)
   ```python
   '--onefile',  # Change to:
   '--onedir',   # Creates dist/TradeProcessingPipeline/ folder
   ```
   Result: Faster startup, ~200MB smaller

2. **Exclude unnecessary modules** (advanced)
   Edit `build_exe.py` and add:
   ```python
   '--exclude-module=matplotlib',
   '--exclude-module=scipy',
   ```

### Manual Build (Using PyInstaller Directly)

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ^
  --name=TradeProcessingPipeline ^
  --add-data="unified-streamlit-app.py;." ^
  --add-data="input_parser.py;." ^
  --add-data="Trade_Parser.py;." ^
  --hidden-import=streamlit ^
  --collect-all=streamlit ^
  app_launcher.py
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**"PyInstaller not found"**
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

**"Module not found" errors during build**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"UPX is not available"** (Warning - can ignore)
This is just a compression tool. Build still works without it.

**Antivirus blocks PyInstaller**
- Add Python folder to antivirus exceptions
- Add project folder to exceptions
- Temporarily disable antivirus during build

### Runtime Issues (on target PC)

**Exe doesn't start**
- Run from command prompt to see errors
- Check Windows Event Viewer for details

**"Failed to execute script"**
- Rebuild with `--console` to see error details
- Check all dependencies in requirements.txt

**Slow startup (30+ seconds)**
- Normal for first run (unpacking)
- Subsequent runs are faster
- Use `--onedir` build for faster startup

**Browser doesn't open**
- Manually open: http://localhost:8501
- Check firewall isn't blocking
- Port 8501 might be in use (app auto-selects free port)

## üìä Build Comparison

| Build Type | File Size | Startup Time | Distribution |
|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| --onefile  | ~800 MB   | 10-20 sec    | 1 exe file   |
| --onedir   | ~600 MB   | 2-5 sec      | 1 folder     |

**Recommendation**: Use `--onefile` for easiest distribution (single file)

## üîê Security Notes

### Code Signing (Optional but Recommended)

Unsigned executables may trigger Windows SmartScreen warnings.

**To sign the exe:**
1. Get a code signing certificate
2. Use `signtool` (Windows SDK):
```bash
signtool sign /f certificate.pfx /p password /t http://timestamp.digicert.com TradeProcessingPipeline.exe
```

### Antivirus False Positives

PyInstaller exes sometimes trigger false positives because:
- They unpack themselves at runtime
- They execute Python code

**Solutions**:
1. Submit to antivirus vendors (VirusTotal)
2. Code sign the executable
3. Build on clean system (not developer machine)

## üì§ Distribution

### Single PC
Just copy the .exe file

### Multiple PCs
1. **Zip and share**:
   ```bash
   zip TradeProcessingPipeline.zip dist/TradeProcessingPipeline.exe
   ```

2. **Network share**:
   - Place exe on network drive
   - Users can run directly

3. **Web download**:
   - Upload to company file server
   - Users download and run

### First-Time User Instructions

Create a simple guide for users:

```
=== Trade Processing Pipeline - User Guide ===

1. Download: TradeProcessingPipeline.exe
2. Save to: Any folder (e.g., Desktop or Documents/TradeApp)
3. Run: Double-click the exe file
4. Wait: 10-20 seconds for first launch
5. Browser will open automatically
6. Upload your files and process trades

To close: Close the console window or press Ctrl+C

Note: The app runs locally on your PC.
No data is sent to external servers (except Yahoo Finance for prices).
```

## üîÑ Updates

When you update the code:
1. Run `python build_exe.py` again
2. Distribute new exe to users
3. Users replace old exe with new one
4. No uninstall/reinstall needed

## üí° Tips

1. **Test the exe** on a clean Windows PC (or VM) before distributing
2. **Include README** with the exe explaining how to use it
3. **Version the exe** (e.g., TradeProcessingPipeline_v5.0.exe)
4. **Keep build environment clean** - fresh Python install builds smaller exes
5. **Compress with UPX** (optional) for smaller file size:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller[encryption]
   ```

## üìû Support

If users have issues running the exe:
1. Ask them to run from command prompt to see errors
2. Check their Windows version (7 or later required)
3. Check they have a web browser installed
4. Check antivirus isn't blocking it
5. Rebuild with `--console` flag to show detailed errors
